; Define the desired Frequency. Valid options are M2, M4, M8, M16 and M32

; Define the desired SckDelay. Valid options are in the range 0 to 255

; Define SPI interface timing. Valid options are in the range of 0 to 7.
; This argument is only used for devices where the dll function NRFJPROG_qspi_set_rx_delay() is supported.

; Define the desired IO level for DIO2 and DIO3 during a custom instruction. Valid options are LEVEL_HIGH and LEVEL_LOW
CustomInstructionIO2Level = LEVEL_LOW
CustomInstructionIO3Level = LEVEL_HIGH

; Define the assigned pins for the QSPI peripheral. Valid options are those existing in your device
; For nRF53, QSPI pins are not configurable and these values are ignored.

; Define the Index of the Write In Progress (WIP) bit in the status register. Valid options are in the range of 0 to 7.

; Custom instructions to send to the external memory after initialization. Format is instruction code plus data to send in between optional brackets.
; These instructions will be executed each time the qspi peripheral is initiated by nrfjprog.
; To improve execution speed on consecutive interactions with QSPI, you can run nrfjprog once with custom initialization, and then comment out the lines below.
; Numbers can be given in decimal, hex (starting with either 0x or 0X) and binary (starting with either 0b or 0B) formats.
; The custom instructions will be executed in the order found.
; This example includes two commands, first a WREN (WRite ENable) and then a WRSR (WRite Status Register) enabling the Quad Operation and the High Performance
; mode for the MX25R6435F memory present in the nRF52840 DK.
;InitializationCustomInstruction =  0x06
;InitializationCustomInstruction =  0x01, [0x40, 0, 0x2]

; If retention is enabled, device RAM contents will be read and buffered during QSPI driver initialization.
; The buffered data will be written back to the device when uninitializing the driver, restoring the original device RAM state.
; Enabled: RetainRAM = 1, Disabled: RetainRAM = 0
RetainRAM = 0
