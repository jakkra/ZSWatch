# WatchDK Quick Start

![ZSWatch Development Kit (WatchDK)](../../blog/2025-12-05-dk-and-hr/watchdk.jpg)

This guide walks you through setting up your **ZSWatch Development Kit (WatchDK)** for the first time - from powering on to having a fully working smartwatch UI with icons and images.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::warning Known Issues from Early Shipments
We have received one report so far from early shipments:
- **Back button not working**: Currently being investigated, reach out if you have this issue.
- **Production test firmware still running (bootloader not flashed):** If your watch does not boot into the normal ZSWatch UI and appears to be running test firmware, the bootloader may not have been programmed during production. If this is the case you need to follow the debugger instructions below. Please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8XfNBmDfbY) (preferred) or send an email to [mail@zswatch.dev](mailto:mail@zswatch.dev) and we will help you resolve it.
- **Missing jumper:** One report of a jumper missing from the board. Before starting, verify that the jumper is present at the flash chip (tip of arrow), if not move one according to the image below:

**If you did not have any of those issues, feel free to also let us know, so we can understand what went wrong in production.**

## What You Need

| Item | Required? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **USB-C cable** | Yes | For power and optional USB firmware updates |
| **WatchDK** (with display & vibration motor connected) | Yes | Ships assembled and tested with display & motor pre-connected |
| **Debugger** (recommended: Nordic **nRF54L15 DK**, ~**$35**) | Optional | Needed if you want to develop the FW and flash via SWD instead of USB/BLE. A SEGGER J-Link works too, but is more expensive |
| **10-pin 1.27mm SWD cable** | Optional | Needed to connect the debugger to the WatchDK. Example cables: [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1675), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Treedix-Ribbon-Connector-1-27mm-Connecting/dp/B09JK5HD3X) |
| **Battery** (LiPo) | Optional | The DK runs fine from USB power alone. See [battery section](#optional-battery--rtc-jumper) at the end |

## Optional: Debugger Setup (nRF54L15 DK)

If you plan to develop firmware or flash via SWD, connect a Nordic **nRF54L15 DK** as a debugger. For full wiring details (SWD cable, GND, UART log pin connections, and RTT alternative), see the **[Debugger Hardware Setup](../development/debugging.md#debugger-hardware-setup-nrf54l15-dk)** section in the Debugging guide.

## Step 1 - Power On

1. Connect the USB-C cable to the WatchDK.
2. The watch should boot into the ZSWatch UI.
3. Try press top right button to open the application picker.

:::info No icons yet?
The watch ships with firmware but **without image resources**. The UI will work, but icons and graphics will be missing until you upload them in [Step 3](#step-3---upload-image-resources).
:::

## Step 2 - Update Firmware

We recommend updating to the latest firmware as the first thing you do.

### Enable Updates on the Watch

Before any USB or BLE update, you must enable it on the watch:

1. On the watch, navigate to **Apps → Update**.
2. Set **USB** and/or **BLE** to **ON** depending on which method you plan to use.

### Choose Your Update Method

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="web" label="Web Update (no debugger needed)" default>

  This method requires no extra hardware.

  1. Make sure you enabled USB or BLE updates on the watch (see above).
  2. Go to [zswatch.dev/update](https://zswatch.dev/update).
  3. Follow the on-screen instructions to flash via USB or BLE.

  For details on firmware files and other update methods, see [Firmware Updates](../firmware/firmware_updates.md).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="debugger" label="Debugger (SWD)">

  Use this method if you have a debugger connected and want to flash via SWD.

  See [Firmware Updates](../firmware/firmware_updates.md) for the full SWD flashing steps (pre-built firmware and building from source).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3 - Upload Image Resources

Many icons and images in the ZSWatch UI are stored in external flash and are **not** included in the firmware binary itself. They need to be uploaded separately. The image resources file (`lvgl_resources_raw.bin`) is included in the firmware download package, so you already have it.

The **easiest method** is the web updater, no debugger required:

1. On the watch, go to **Apps → Update** and enable **USB** and/or **BLE**.
2. Go to [zswatch.dev/update](https://zswatch.dev/update).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload image resources via USB or BLE.

See the full [Image Resources](../development/image_resources.md) guide for more details.


:::tip Alternatively with debugger
If you have a debugger connected, you can upload images from VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and running the task **Upload Raw FS**, or from the terminal:
```bash
west upload_fs --type raw --ini_file app/boards/zswatch/watchdk/support/qspi_mx25u51245.ini
```
Or directly using `nrfjprog`
```
nrfjprog -f nrf53 \
  --program lvgl_resources_raw.hex \
  --qspisectorerase --verify --reset \
  --qspiini app/boards/zswatch/watchdk/support/qspi_mx25u51245.ini \
  --coprocessor CP_APPLICATION
```
:::

## Step 4 - Done!

Your WatchDK should now be running the latest firmware with all icons and images visible. Navigate around the UI using the four buttons and the touchscreen.

If you want to view logs or debug the firmware, see the **[Debugging guide](../development/debugging.md)**, including how to connect the nRF54L15 DK for UART logs or use RTT.

## Optional: Battery & RTC Jumper

The WatchDK works without a battery - USB-C provides all the power needed. However, the **real-time clock (RTC)** needs a power source to retain the time.

### Without a Battery (Default)

Set the RTC jumper so that the RTC is powered from **VSYS** (USB power) instead of VBAT. This way the RTC works while USB is connected, but time will be lost when unplugged.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em', marginBottom: '1em'}}>
  Jumper configuration - ensure the RTC power jumper is set to VSYS when no battery is connected.
</div>

</div>

### With a Battery

If you add a battery, move the RTC (Battery) jumper to **VBAT** so the RTC stays powered even when USB is disconnected.

## Next Steps

- **[Setting up the Development Toolchain](../development/toolchain.md)** - install VS Code, nRF Connect SDK, and build tools
- **[Compiling the Software](../development/compiling.md)** - build custom firmware from source
- **[Firmware Recovery](../firmware/firmware_recovery.md)** - if the watch becomes unresponsive
