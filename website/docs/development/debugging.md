# Debugging

## Debugger Hardware Setup (nRF54L15 DK)

The recommended debugger is the Nordic **nRF54L15 DK** (~$35), connected via a 10-pin 1.27mm SWD cable.

- **SWD cable**: Connect the 10-pin cable between the nRF54L15DK's Debug Out connector and the WatchDK's SWD header.
- **UART logs**: Connect the WatchDK's **UART TxD** pin to **P0.00** on the nRF54L15 DK. This routes log output to **VCOM0** on the nRF54L15 DK. All pre-built firmwares use UART logging, open a serial terminal on VCOM0 at **115200 baud**.
- **GND**: If no SWD cable is connected, also connect a GND wire between the two boards.

:::tip No hardware for UART logs?
If you don't have a debugger or serial adapter, compile the firmware with **RTT** enabled and view logs over the SWD connection instead. See [Compiling the Software](./compiling.md) for build options.

## On-Target Debugging (WatchDK / ZSWatch)

On-target debugging is handled through the **nRF Connect VS Code extension**, which provides GDB integration with the J-Link debugger.

### Prerequisites

- A debugger connected via the **10-pin 1.27mm SWD cable** (J-Link or nRF54L15 DK)
- A build configuration created in VS Code (see [Compiling the Software](./compiling.md))

### Start Debugging

1. In VS Code, open the **nRF Connect** sidebar.
2. Under your build configuration, click **Actions → Debug**.
3. Use standard VS Code debugging controls: breakpoints, step over/into, variable inspection, call stack, etc.

### Reading Logs

Depending on your build configuration, logs are available through different transports:

| Transport | How to read |
|-----------|-------------|
| **UART** | Connect to the serial port (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux) at 115200 baud. Use `minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyUSB0` or `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`. |
| **RTT** | Use SEGGER RTT Viewer or `JLinkRTTLogger` while the J-Link is connected. The nRF Connect extension also supports RTT output. |
| **USB** | Connect via USB and open the CDC ACM serial port that appears. |

See the [Compiling](./compiling.md#debug-logging) page for how to select a log transport in your build.

### Resetting the Watch
Use nRF Connect VSCode plugin -> CONNECTED DEVICES -> Reset button

OR:

```bash
nrfjprog --reset
```

## Native Simulator Debugging (Linux)

The native simulator compiles ZSWatch as a Linux executable, allowing you to debug with standard GDB, with full variable inspection, breakpoints, and LVGL UI interaction in a simulated display window.

For full setup instructions, see the [Native Simulator](./linux_development.md) page.

### Quick Start

1. Build for `native_sim/native/64` (see [Native Simulator - Build](./linux_development.md#2-build-the-project)).
2. In VS Code, go to **Run and Debug** (`Ctrl+Shift+D`).
3. Select **Debug Native (with sudo)** and press **F5**.
4. A simulated display window will open. Debug logs appear in the VS Code terminal.

:::tip
The native simulator is the fastest way to iterate on UI and application logic. No hardware or flash cycle needed.

## Coredump Debugging

ZSWatch has a built-in coredump system that captures crash information (registers, stack) when a fatal error or assertion occurs. The coredump is stored in retained RAM, then written to the filesystem (`/lvgl_lfs/coredump.txt`) on the next boot.

### Viewing a Coredump on the Watch

1. After a crash, the watch will reboot automatically.
2. Open the **Info** app on the watch.
3. If a coredump was captured, it will show the crash summary (file name, line number, timestamp).
4. From the Info app, you can **dump the coredump to the log output**, this prints the coredump data to whatever log transport you have configured (UART, RTT, or USB).

### Analyzing a Coredump

:::note
Run `west coredump` from the **nRF Connect shell** (e.g. via the nRF Connect VS Code extension terminal), where the required Python dependencies are installed.
:::

1. **Start `west coredump`** and let it wait for the coredump data. Use `--build_dir` to let west find the ELF and toolchain automatically.

   **Via UART**:
   ```bash
   west coredump --build_dir app/build_dbg_dk --serial_port /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```

   **Via RTT** (requires debugger connected):
   ```bash
   west coredump --build_dir app/build_dbg_dk
   ```

   Or specify the ELF and toolchain manually with `--elf` and `--toolchain` instead of `--build_dir`.

2. **On the watch**, open the **Info** app, then press the **download button** to output the coredump to the log. `west coredump` automatically captures it and loads the crash state into GDB.

3. You can now inspect variables, stack frames, and memory at the time of the crash.

:::caution
The `.elf` file must match the **exact firmware build** that was running when the crash occurred. If you rebuild, the addresses won't match and the backtrace will be wrong.

If you are running a **pre-built firmware** (downloaded from GitHub Releases or CI), the matching `.elf` file is included inside the downloaded firmware `.zip` archive.
:::

### Erasing a Stored Coredump

From the Zephyr shell (if enabled):

```
zsw coredump_erase 0
```

Or the coredump can be erased from the Info app on the watch.
