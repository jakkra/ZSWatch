This Privacy Policy describes how ZSWatch Companion App ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Device pairing information**: When you pair your ZSWatch with the app, we store the device identifier locally on your phone to enable automatic reconnection.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Bluetooth data**: The app communicates with your ZSWatch over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to sync notifications, health data, and settings.
- **Location data**: If you grant permission, the app may access your location to relay GPS coordinates to your watch for weather and fitness features. Location data is sent directly to your watch and is not stored or transmitted elsewhere.

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local storage only**: All data is stored locally on your device. We do not have servers that collect or store your personal information.
- **No cloud sync**: Your health data, notifications, and settings are not uploaded to any cloud service.
- **No analytics**: We do not use third-party analytics services that track your usage.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. The app may connect to:
- **GitHub**: To download firmware updates (no personal data is sent)
